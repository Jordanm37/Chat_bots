This is stated in clause 42.03-2 of the Nillumbik Planning Scheme, which requires a permit to be obtained for the construction of a building or to carry out works, including the pruning or lopping of the trunk of a native tree, unless a schedule to the overlay specifically states that a permit is not required. Therefore, if the schedule to the overlay does not specifically state that a permit is not required for pruning of a native tree, then a permit must be obtained.\\n\\nThe relevant clause is:\\n\\nVC224 Permit requirement\\nA permit is required to:\\n- Construct a building or to carry out works. This does not apply:\\n- If a schedule to this overlay specifically states that a permit is not required.\\n- To the conduct of agricultural activities including ploughing and fencing (but not the construction of dams) unless a specific requirement for that activity is specified in a schedule to this overlay.\\n- Construct a fence if specified in the schedule to this overlay.\\n- Remove, destroy or lop any vegetation specified in a schedule to this overlay. This does not apply:\\n- Lopping or pruning native vegetation, for maintenance only, provided no more than 1/3 of the foliage of each individual plant is lopped or pruned. Lopping and pruning for maintenance.\\n- Native vegetation that is to be removed, destroyed or lopped to the minimum extent necessary by the holder of an exploration, mining, prospecting, or retention license issued under the Mineral Resources (Sustainable Development) Act 1990: Mineral exploration and extraction that is low impact exploration within the meaning of Schedule 4A of the Mineral Resources (Sustainable Development) Act 1990; or in accordance with a work plan approved under Part 3 of the Mineral Resources (Sustainable Development) Act 1990.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the exemption for lopping or pruning native vegetation for maintenance only does not apply to the pruning or lopping of the trunk of a native tree, as stated in the relevant documents provided.',\n",

       "(\"The Nillumbik Planning Scheme contains several sections and clauses that govern landscaping and tree removal. Key provisions and permit requirements can be found in the following sections:\\n\\n1. Vegetation Protection Overlay (VPO): Found under Clause 42.02, this overlay aims to protect and conserve native vegetation throughout the municipality. Permit requirements and exemptions for removing, lopping, or destroying vegetation are specified.\\n\\n2. Significant Landscape Overlays (SLO): Clause 42.03 addresses areas with significant landscape values. Schedules 2, 3, and 4 (SLO2, SLO3, SLO4) focus on significant trees and vegetation. These schedules outline permit requirements and exemptions for certain types of tree and vegetation removal, as well as pruning or lopping. Key requirements and exemptions are as follows:\\n\\n   - SLO2: A permit is required to remove, destroy, or lop any native vegetation, unless it's for maintenance only and no more than 1/3 of the foliage of each individual plant is lopped or pruned. A permit is also needed to construct a front fence. However, no permit is required for constructing a building or carrying out works if they are more than 5 meters from the base of any substantial tree.\\n   \\n   - SLO3 and SLO4: A permit is required to remove, destroy, or lop any substantial tree, unless the lopping is for regeneration or ornamental shaping, or the removal is of dead trees or dead limbs, or for partial removal of limbs and branches directly overhanging dwellings, garages, and outbuildings, or for removal of Kunzea leptospermoides (Yarra Burgan) for fire prevention purposes. A permit is also needed to construct a front fence. However, no permit is required for constructing a building or carrying out works if the building is no more than 7.5 meters above the natural ground surface and at least 5 meters from the base of any substantial tree (SLO3) or if they are more than 5 meters from the base of any substantial tree (SLO4).\\n\\n3. Environmental Significance Overlay (ESO): Located in Clause 42.01, this overlay identifies areas with environmental significance and contains regulations regarding vegetation removal and landscaping. Different schedules (e.g., ESO1, ESO2, ESO3, etc.) apply to various parts of the municipality, with permit requirements and exemptions outlined according to the specific schedule affecting each property.\\n\\nGeneral regulations on tree removal and landscaping can also be found in:\\n\\n- Clause 52.17: Native Vegetation - Regulates removal, destruction, or lopping of native vegetation throughout the Nillumbik Planning Scheme, specifying permit requirements and exemptions.\\n- Clause 32.09 - Neighbourhood Residential Zone: Relevant for landscaping in residential contexts, with clauses 32.09-4 (subdivision) and 32.09-8 addressing landscaping requirements and landscape design principles.\\n\\nAs permit requirements and exemptions vary depending on the property's specific zone, overlay, and schedule, it is crucial to review the relevant sections for your situation. Please consult the Nillumbik Planning Scheme at https://planningschemes.dpcd.vic.gov.au/schemes/nillumbik for more information.\",\n",

       "('Under the Nillumbik Planning Scheme, there are various clauses, schedules, and overlays that regulate landscaping and tree removal, including the Vegetation Protection Overlay (VPO), Significant Landscape Overlay (SLO), Environmental Significance Overlay (ESO), and other clauses such as Clause 52.17 - Native Vegetation and Clause 52.12 - Bushfire Protection: Exemptions. These aim to protect and enhance the natural environment and landscape values of the region.\\n\\n1. **Vegetation Protection Overlay (VPO) - Clause 42.02**: The VPO identifies significant vegetation and controls the removal, destruction, or lopping of this vegetation. A permit is required to remove, destroy, or lop any vegetation specified in a schedule to the overlay, subject to some exemptions such as removing vegetation listed as a noxious weed, for emergency access, or as stated in a specific schedule (Schedule 1 to 6).\\n\\n2. **Significant Landscape Overlay (SLO) - Clause 42.03**: The SLO aims to conserve and enhance the character of significant landscapes. A permit is required to construct a building, carry out works, or remove/destroy/lop any vegetation per the relevant schedule to the overlay (Schedule 1 to 9). The rules under the SLO vary depending on the specific schedule:\\n\\n   - **SLO Schedule 2**: A permit is needed for removing, destroying, or lopping any native vegetation and constructing a front fence. A permit is not required for construction or works more than 5 meters from the base of any substantial tree.\\n   \\n   - **SLO Schedule 3 and 4**: A permit is needed for removing, destroying, or lopping any substantial tree, constructing a front fence, and exemptions exist for regeneration, ornamental shaping, or removal of dead trees/limbs. A permit is not required for construction or works more than 5 meters from the base of any substantial tree, or if the height of any part of the building is no more than 7.5 meters above the natural surface of the ground directly below it (SLO Schedule 3 only).\\n\\nIn addition, the Nillumbik Planning Scheme includes guidelines and objectives to ensure the dominance of vegetation cover, compatibility with existing development scale, setbacks, character, and to minimize threats from unnecessary removal of vegetation.\\n\\n3. **Environmental Significance Overlay (ESO) - Clause 42.01**: The ESO aims to protect areas with significant environmental, social, or aesthetic values. A permit may be required for tree removal or landscaping activities based on specific requirements outlined in the relevant schedule to the overlay.\\n\\n4. **Clause 52.17 - Native Vegetation**: This clause addresses the removal, destruction, or lopping of native vegetation throughout Victoria. A permit may be required for the removal of native vegetation, subject to certain exemptions.\\n\\n5. **Clause 52.12 - Bushfire Protection: Exemptions**: In areas with bushfire risk, there may be exemptions allowing for vegetation removal without a permit for bushfire protection measures.\\n\\nTo determine the specific regulations on landscaping or tree removal for your property, consult the Nillumbik Planning Scheme and seek professional advice if necessary. The relevant clauses and schedules can be accessed at https://planningschemes.dpcd.vic.gov.au/schemes/nillumbik.\\n\\nNote that these regulations may contradict each other in certain scenarios, so it is essential to refer to the relevant overlays and clauses and consider seeking professional advice to ensure compliance.',\n",

       " 'chat_history': [],\n",
       " 'answer': 'The Nillumbik Planning Scheme has several regulations on landscaping and tree removal, depending on the specific overlay schedule that applies to the area in question. \\n\\nUnder the Significant Landscape Overlay Schedule 2, which applies to bush and semi-bush residential areas, a permit is required to remove, destroy, or lop any native vegetation, including substantial trees, unless the lopping is for maintenance only and no more than 1/3 of the foliage of each individual plant is lopped or pruned. A permit is also required to construct a front fence. However, a permit is not required to construct a building or carry out works if the building or works are at least 5 meters from the base of any substantial tree.\\n\\nUnder the Significant Landscape Overlay Schedule 3, which applies to areas with a bush garden character, a permit is required to remove, destroy, or lop any substantial tree, unless the lopping is for regeneration or ornamental shaping, or the removal is of dead trees or dead limbs, or the partial removal of limbs and branches directly overhanging dwellings, garages, and outbuildings, or the removal of Kunzea leptospermoides (Yarra Burgan) for fire prevention purposes. A permit is also required to construct a front fence. However, a permit is not required to construct a building or carry out works if the height of any part of the building is no more than 7.5 meters above the natural surface of the ground directly below it, and the building or works are at least 5 meters from the base of any substantial tree.\\n\\nUnder the Significant Landscape Overlay Schedule 4, which applies to areas with a garden court character, a permit is required to remove, destroy, or lop any substantial tree, unless the lopping is for regeneration or ornamental shaping, or the removal is of dead trees or dead limbs, or the partial removal of limbs and branches directly overhanging dwellings, garages, and outbuildings, or the removal of Kunzea leptospermoides (Yarra Burgan) for fire prevention purposes. A permit is also required to construct a front fence. However, a permit is not required to construct a building or carry out works if the building or works are more than 5 meters from the base of any substantial tree.\\n\\nIt is important to note that these regulations are subject to additional decision guidelines and landscape character objectives, as well as the need to ensure that development is compatible with the scale, setbacks, and character of existing development, and that it is sensitive to the natural characteristics of the land, including slope, terrain, services, and any existing vegetation.

Clause 42.03 Significant Landscape Overlay (SLO):\\nThis clause provides an overlay designed to protect significant landscapes and conserve native trees. Depending on the schedule and zoning of your property, you may be subject to different requirements and exemptions. For example, Schedule 2 to the SLO (SLO2) focuses on tree conservation, which can trigger a permit requirement for removing, destroying, or lopping native vegetation, including pruning native trees.\\n\\n2. Clause 52.17 Native Vegetation:\\nThis clause deals with the removal, destruction, or lopping of native vegetation, aiming to achieve a net gain in the quality and extent of native vegetation. A permit is generally required to remove, destroy, or lop native vegetation, including to remove dead native vegetation. However, there are some exemptions listed in Clause 52.17-6, which include, but are not limited to, removing vegetation for specific public infrastructure works, wildfire management, or to maintain utility services.\\n\\n3. Vegetation Protection Overlay (VPO) (if applicable):\\nSome properties in Nillumbik may also be subject to a Vegetation Protection Overlay, which provides further regulations to protect significant vegetation, such as remnant indigenous vegetation or native vegetation with high habitat value. The specific requirements and exemptions depend on the schedule to the VPO.\\n\\nPlease be aware that this is not an exhaustive list of all potential planning provisions in the Nillumbik Planning Scheme related to landscaping and tree removal.

Depending on the schedule and zoning of your property, you may be subject to different requirements and exemptions.\\n\\n   - **SLO Schedule 2 (SLO2)**: Applies to bush and semi-bush residential areas. A permit is required to remove, destroy, or lop any native vegetation, including substantial trees, unless the lopping is for maintenance only and no more than 1/3 of the foliage of each individual plant is lopped or pruned. A permit is also required to construct a front fence. However, a permit is not required to construct a building or carry out works if the building or works are at least 5 meters from the base of any substantial tree.\\n\\n   - **SLO Schedule 3 (SLO3)**: Applies to areas with a bush garden character. A permit is required to remove, destroy, or lop any substantial tree, unless the lopping is for regeneration or ornamental shaping, or the removal is of dead trees or dead limbs, or the partial removal of limbs and branches directly overhanging dwellings, garages, and outbuildings, or the removal of Kunzea leptospermoides (Yarra Burgan) for fire prevention purposes.

A permit is required to remove, destroy, or lop any substantial tree, unless the lopping is for regeneration or ornamental shaping, or the removal is of dead trees or dead limbs, or the partial removal of limbs and branches directly overhanging dwellings, garages, and outbuildings, or the removal of Kunzea leptospermoides (Yarra Burgan) for fire prevention purposes. A permit is also required to construct a front fence. However, a permit is not required to construct a building or carry out works if the building or works are more than 5 meters from the base of any substantial tree.\\n\\n   These regulations are subject to additional decision guidelines and landscape character objectives, as well as the need to ensure that development is compatible with the scale, setbacks, and character of existing development, and that it is sensitive to the natural characteristics of the land, including slope, terrain, services, and any existing vegetation.\\n\\n2. **Clause 52.17 Native Vegetation**: This clause deals with the removal, destruction, or lopping of native vegetation, aiming to achieve a net gain in the quality and extent of native vegetation.
