Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Sales Representative position at American Express, as advertised. I am a seasoned sales and customer service professional with a background in risk management, customer service quality assurance, and VIP account management, and I believe that my unique skills and experiences make me a strong candidate for this position.

In my previous roles at Sportsbet, I demonstrated a capacity for delivering exceptional customer service, meeting and exceeding set KPIs, demonstrating high computer literacy, and promoting business growth and revenue generation. For example, I managed a portfolio of approximately 120 VIP customers, fostering engagement, loyalty, and increased spending. Consistently exceeding monthly review targets and maintaining a 98% quality of service rating, significantly above KPIs. I believe these experiences align with the requirements you are seeking for the Sales Representative role.

What interests me about American Express is its commitment to providing customers with innovative payment, travel, and expense management solutions to enrich lives and build business success. Your commitment to this, as well as your collaborative, innovative, and engaging culture, particularly resonates with my own professional values.

I am particularly adept at assisted selling and merchandising, as demonstrated through my previous role as a Customer Stylist, Salesperson, and Shift Supervisor at Calibre Clothing & Dick Smith. Here, I ensured superior customer service and boosted sales by offering tailored product demonstrations, comprehensive product knowledge, effective upselling, and developing new sales leads. My attention to detail and my ability to work effectively in a team environment will allow me to promote business success in this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to American Express and look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my background, skills, and experience can benefit your team.

Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience at 0400798616 to arrange a time to discuss how I can make a meaningful contribution to your organization.

Sincerely,
Patrick Merola
