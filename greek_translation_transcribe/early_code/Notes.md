**Component Details:**

1. **Activity Generator:**
        - The activity generator will provide engaging language learning activities based on user proficiency.
    - Input: User's current proficiency level, learning history, preferences.
    - Output: Generated activity that matches user's current level and learning style.
    - The back-end will use the `activity_generator.py` script that communicates with the OpenAI API.
    - The front-end will render the generated activity and handle user interactions.
2. **Translation (with dictionary definitions as source):**
    - The translation feature allows the user to input a word or phrase in their language and get the translation in Greek.
    - Input: User's text in source language.
    - Output: Translated text in Greek.
    - The back-end uses `translation.py` script that utilizes the OpenAI API.
    - The front-end will have a form for users to input text and a display area to present translated text.
3. **Real-time Transcription and Translation:**
    - This feature transcribes spoken language and translates it into Greek in real-time.
    - Input: Spoken language through a microphone.
    - Output: Transcribed and translated text in Greek.
    - The back-end leverages `transcription.py` and `real_time_translation.py` scripts, interfacing with OpenAI API.
    - The front-end will require microphone access and display the transcribed and translated text.
4. **PDF Translation:**
    - Users can upload a PDF in their language and get it translated into Greek.
    - Input: PDF document.
    - Output: Translated PDF text in Greek.
    - The back-end utilizes `pdf_extractor.py` and `pdf_translation.py` scripts.
    - The front-end will need to include a PDF upload feature and display the translated content.
5. **Lesson Plan Generator:**
    - The lesson plan generator will tailor-make lessons based on user proficiency and interests.
    - Input: User's current proficiency level, learning history, preferences.
    - Output: Personalized lesson plan.
    - The back-end uses `lesson_plan_generator.py` script interfacing with the OpenAI API.
    - The front-end displays the lesson plans in an interactive and user-friendly format.

**Front-End:**
The front-end should be a Single-Page Application (SPA) built using React.js. It should provide an intuitive and engaging user interface for users to interact with the various components of the GLLC.
